# Kalman-Filtering-and-Sensor-Fusion-Project
This repo is for the project and exersice in the " Advanced Kalman Filtering and Sensor Fusion" Udemy course
https://kpitindia.udemy.com/course/advanced-kalman-filtering-and-sensor-fusion/learn/lecture/27760254#overview

## Theory
### Kalman Filter Types
#### Linear KF (LKF)
#### Extended KF (EKF)
#### Uncented KF (UKF)

## Algorithm

* bullet

## Hints
* the prediction step forward in time (from $x_{k-1}$ to $x_k$), while the update step enhance the current step (from $x^-_k$ to $x^+_k$)
*
## Pitfalls
the filter should be consistent. meaning the true state should be alwarys inside the uncertainity bounds
